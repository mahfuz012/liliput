              SafePay helps provide transparency on the platform. It is a shared
              account that is funded by the Employer before starting work. When
              SafePay is funded, the Freelancer can feel confident that funds
              are available, and the Employer feels secure that work can be
              reviewed before making the payment.

        Funds in SafePay are not tied to one specific job or task and can be used to make payments for any work done with respect to the job on our online freelance marketplace. An Employer can pay for tasks, milestones, hours, miscellaneous work, or even bonuses. Funds can be released to either the Employer or the Freelancer. In the case of a disagreement, either party can request Arbitration, as long as funds are available in SafePay.

    <p>Yes, SafePay is free to use by both Employers and Freelancers. However, if Arbitration is requested, we charge an Arbitration Fee of either $25 or 5% of the SafePay balance (whichever is higher). This fee is taken from the funds in SafePay. If SafePay balance is $50 or less, we waive our fee and the balance is distributed equally between the Employer and the Freelancer.</p>
